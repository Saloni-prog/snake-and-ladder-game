# snake-and-ladder-game
Snake and Ladder game project in C demonstrating arrays, loops, functions, and basic game logic in a console environment
# 🎲 Snake and Ladder Game (C)

This project is a **console-based Snake and Ladder game** written in C.  
It recreates the classic board game where players roll a dice, climb ladders, avoid snakes, and try to reach the 100th square first.

## ✨ Features
- Supports **2 or more players**
- **Random dice roll** using `rand()`
- **Snakes** bring you down, **ladders** lift you up
- Simple **turn-based gameplay** in the terminal
- Built using basic **C concepts** (arrays, loops, functions)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** C  
- **Libraries Used:** `stdio.h`, `stdlib.h`, `time.h`

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository

## navigate to the folder
cd snake-and-ladder-c
## compile the code
gcc snake_ladder.c -o snake_ladder
## run the game
./snake_ladder
## learning outcomes
This project helps practice:
-Control structures in C
-Random number generation
-Functions & modular programming
